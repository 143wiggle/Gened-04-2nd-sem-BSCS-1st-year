 UTILITARIANISM – REVIEWER
1. What is Utilitarianism?
Definition: An ethical theory that determines right and wrong based on consequences.

Main Principle: An action is morally right if it produces the greatest happiness for the greatest number.

Type of Ethics: Consequentialism (focuses on results, not intentions).

2. Key Philosophers & Their Theories
🔹 Jeremy Bentham (Act Utilitarianism)
Humans are governed by pain and pleasure.

The morality of an act is determined by how much happiness or suffering it creates.

Introduced Hedonistic Calculus to measure happiness based on:

Intensity (How strong is the pleasure?)

Duration (How long does it last?)

Certainty (How likely is it to happen?)

Fecundity (Will it lead to more pleasure?)

Purity (Will it bring pain along with it?)

Extent (How many people are affected?)

🔹 John Stuart Mill (Rule Utilitarianism)
Disagreed with Bentham’s pure pleasure-focused approach.

Stressed quality over quantity of pleasure:

Higher pleasures (intellectual, moral, cultural).

Lower pleasures (bodily, immediate satisfaction).

Famous Quote: “It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied.”

3. Four Main Theses of Utilitarianism
Consequentialism – The morality of an action is determined by its outcome.

Hedonism – The greatest good is pleasure/happiness.

Maximalism – The best action produces the most good and the least harm.

Universalism – The happiness of everyone counts equally.

4. Types of Utilitarianism
Type	Key Idea	Philosopher
Act Utilitarianism	An action is good if it produces the most happiness in a specific situation.	Jeremy Bentham
Rule Utilitarianism	An action is good if it follows rules that generally maximize happiness.	John Stuart Mill
Example:

Act Utilitarianism → Lying is okay if it makes people happy in that moment.

Rule Utilitarianism → Lying is bad because, in general, it leads to distrust.

5. Real-World Applications
🔹 Ethical Decision-Making

Used in business, law, and politics (e.g., sacrificing few for many).

🔹 Historical Cases

WWII Coventry Bombing – The British knew about the attack but didn’t warn the people to avoid exposing their intelligence source.

Utilitarian view: Sacrificing some people was necessary to save millions.

Ford Pinto Case – Ford sold unsafe cars because fixing them was more expensive than paying for lawsuits.

Utilitarian issue: Does profit justify endangering people’s lives?

6. Criticisms of Utilitarianism
It can justify immoral acts.

Example: Killing one person to save ten.

Conflicts with individual rights.

Example: If violating someone’s rights brings more happiness, does that make it okay?

Happiness is hard to measure.

Not all pleasures are equal, and some suffering leads to long-term benefits.

The "Doctrine of Negative Responsibility" (Bernard Williams' Critique)

If you refuse to act, you're still responsible for the bad consequences.

7. Religious & Moral Debates
Some argue that utilitarianism is a "Godless theory" because it focuses on human happiness instead of divine rules.

John Stuart Mill's Response:

“The ethics of utility are in harmony with the Golden Rule: ‘Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.’”

📌 FINAL SUMMARY
✅ Utilitarianism = Greatest Happiness Principle (maximize pleasure, minimize pain).
✅ Bentham → Act Utilitarianism (Hedonistic Calculus).
✅ Mill → Rule Utilitarianism (Higher vs. Lower Pleasures).
✅ Used in law, war, business, and politics to justify sacrifices.
✅ Criticized for justifying immoral acts & ignoring individual rights.
