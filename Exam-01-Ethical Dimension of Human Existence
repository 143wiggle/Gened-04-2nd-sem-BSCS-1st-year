THE ETHICAL DIMENSION OF HUMAN EXISTENCE – APPLICATION QUESTIONS
This section applies the key ethical concepts from your study materials to the given questions.

1. Ethics and Clothing Choices
Question: Are clothes a matter of pure aesthetic taste, or can they be an ethical issue? What about tattoos and piercings?

🔹 Ethical vs. Aesthetic Considerations
Clothing is often seen as an aesthetic choice, but it also has ethical implications:

Sustainability → Fast fashion harms the environment and exploits workers.

Cultural Sensitivity → Wearing cultural symbols without understanding them can be cultural appropriation.

Social Norms → Dress codes can enforce discrimination (e.g., banning hijabs, workplace appearance policies).

🔹 Tattoos & Piercings: Ethical or Personal?
Self-expression vs. Social Judgment → Some view tattoos as a personal choice, while others see them as unprofessional or rebellious.

Religious & Cultural Beliefs → Some cultures view body modifications as sacred, while others see them as taboo.

Workplace Discrimination → Many employers still judge employees based on visible tattoos or piercings.

📌 Summary: Clothes and body modifications are not just aesthetic choices; they reflect social, cultural, and ethical values.
2. Ethical Issue Analysis
Question: Find an article on an ethical issue and answer:
a) Why is this an ethical matter?
b) What is your ethical judgment?
c) What are your reasons for this judgment?

🔹 Example Ethical Issue: AI and Job Automation
Why is this an ethical matter?

AI and automation are replacing human workers, raising questions about fairness, economic justice, and human dignity.

Ethical Judgment:

Businesses should implement AI responsibly to minimize mass unemployment and provide worker retraining programs.

Reasoning:

Utilitarianism → The greatest good is achieved by balancing technological progress and protecting workers.

Deontology → Companies have a moral duty to treat employees as humans, not disposable resources.

3. Subjectivity in Ethics
Question: Comment on: “What I believe must be true if I feel very strongly about it.”

🔹 Emotional vs. Rational Truth
Ethical Relativism: Feelings influence moral beliefs, but strong feelings do not make something objectively true.

Critical Thinking: Ethical decisions should be based on facts, logic, and moral principles, not just emotions.

Example: Someone may strongly believe that capital punishment is justified, but this does not make it objectively right without ethical reasoning.

📌 Summary: Feelings matter, but ethical truths require rational analysis and moral reasoning.
🔥 FINAL REVIEW SUMMARY
✅ Clothing & adornment → Ethical concerns in sustainability, cultural sensitivity, and discrimination.
✅ Ethical issues → Real-world problems require moral reasoning (Utilitarianism, Deontology, Virtue Ethics).
✅ Subjectivity in ethics → Strong feelings do not make something true; critical thinking is essential.
